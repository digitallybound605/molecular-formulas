# molecular-formulas
Project that reads in the formulas, then calculates their weights

The input to you program will be in the following form:

	element ( # of atoms) element (# of atoms) 

For example CO2 would be represented CO(2).  If the ()'s are not present, then assume one (1) atom. 

The element weights will be found in the file "Elements.dat" and will be read into the program. The formulas will be found in the file "Formulas.dat" and will be read into the program.

The program will then calculate and print the weights into a new file "MolecularWeight.out". This shows an example of a bubble sort and binary search.
